# Sudoku-Solver

#Sudoku was a game I loved when I was young and combining my love for coding and technology along with it is an opportunity I couldn't pass up.
#I was interested in algorithms and sought a solution to solve a sudoku board using an algorithm suited for the task.
#Python has been my main coding language of choice so I chose to use to to delve into this project and use a backtracking algorithm to solve a game of sudoku. 
#The  main challenge was finishing this within 24 hours!
